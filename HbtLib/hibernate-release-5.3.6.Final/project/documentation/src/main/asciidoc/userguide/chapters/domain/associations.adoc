Associations describe how two or more entities form a relationship based on a database joining semantics.

[[associations-many-to-one]]
==== `@ManyToOne`

`@ManyToOne` is the most common association, having a direct equivalent in the relational database as well (e.g. foreign key),
and so it establishes a relationship between a child entity and a parent.

Each entity has a lifecycle of its own. Once the `@ManyToOne` association is set, Hibernate will set the associated database foreign key column.

[[associations-one-to-many]]
==== `@OneToMany`

The `@OneToMany` association links a parent entity with one or more child entities.
If the `@OneToMany` doesn't have a mirroring `@ManyToOne` association on the child side, the `@OneToMany` association is unidirectional.
If there is a `@ManyToOne` association on the child side, the `@OneToMany` association is bidirectional and the application developer can navigate this relationship from both ends.

[[associations-one-to-many-unidirectional]]
===== Unidirectional `@OneToMany`

When using a unidirectional `@OneToMany` association, Hibernate resorts to using a link table between the two joining entities.

----
====

[NOTE]
====
The `@OneToMany` association is by definition a parent association, even if it's a unidirectional or a bidirectional one.
Only the parent side of an association makes sense to cascade its entity state transitions to children.

====

When persisting the `Person` entity, the cascade will propagate the persist operation to the underlying `Phone` children as well.
Upon removing a `Phone` from the phones collection, the association row is deleted from the link table, and the `orphanRemoval` attribute will trigger a `Phone` removal as well.

[NOTE]
====
The unidirectional associations are not very efficient when it comes to removing child entities.
In this particular example, upon flushing the persistence context, Hibernate deletes all database child entries and reinserts the ones that are still found in the in-memory persistence context.

On the other hand, a bidirectional `@OneToMany` association is much more efficient because the child entity controls the association.
====

[[associations-one-to-many-bidirectional]]
===== Bidirectional `@OneToMany`

The bidirectional `@OneToMany` association also requires a `@ManyToOne` association on the child side.
Although the Domain Model exposes two sides to navigate this association, behind the scenes, the relational database has only one foreign key for this relationship.

Every bidirectional association must have one owning side only (the child side), the other one being referred to as the _inverse_ (or the `mappedBy`) side.

====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Whenever a bidirectional association is formed, the application developer must make sure both sides are in-sync at all times.
The `addPhone()` and `removePhone()` are utility methods that synchronize both ends whenever a child element is added or removed.
====

Because the `Phone` class has a `@NaturalId` column (the phone number being unique),
the `equals()` and the `hashCode()` can make use of this property, and so the `removePhone()` logic is reduced to the `remove()` Java `Collection` method.

----
====

Unlike the unidirectional `@OneToMany`, the bidirectional association is much more efficient when managing the collection persistence state.
Every element removal only requires a single update (in which the foreign key column is set to `NULL`), and,
if the child entity lifecycle is bound to its owning parent so that the child cannot exist without its parent,
then we can annotate the association with the `orphan-removal` attribute and dissociate the child will trigger a delete statement on the actual child table row as well.

[[associations-one-to-one]]
==== `@OneToOne`

The `@OneToOne` association can either be unidirectional or bidirectional.
A unidirectional association follows the relational database foreign key semantics, the client-side owning the relationship.
A bidirectional association features a `mappedBy` `@OneToOne` parent side too.

[[associations-one-to-one-unidirectional]]
===== Unidirectional `@OneToOne`

[[associations-one-to-one-unidirectional-example]]

[source,sql]
----
include::{extrasdir}/associations-one-to-one-unidirectional-example.sql[]
----
====

From a relational database point of view, the underlying schema is identical to the unidirectional `@ManyToOne` association,
as the client-side controls the relationship based on the foreign key column.

But then, it's unusual to consider the `Phone` as a client-side and the `PhoneDetails` as the parent-side because the details cannot exist without an actual phone.
A much more natural mapping would be if the `Phone` were the parent-side, therefore pushing the foreign key into the `PhoneDetails` table.
This mapping requires a bidirectional `@OneToOne` association as you can see in the following example:

[[associations-one-to-one-bidirectional]]
===== Bidirectional `@OneToOne`

[[associations-one-to-one-bidirectional-example]]
.Bidirectional `@OneToOne`

----

[source,sql]
----
include::{extrasdir}/associations-one-to-one-bidirectional-example.sql[]
----
====

This time, the `PhoneDetails` owns the association, and, like any bidirectional association, the parent-side can propagate its lifecycle to the child-side through cascading.

----
include::{extrasdir}/associations-one-to-one-bidirectional-lifecycle-example.sql[]
----
====

When using a bidirectional `@OneToOne` association, Hibernate enforces the unique constraint upon fetching the child-side.
If there are more than one children associated with the same parent, Hibernate will throw a `org.hibernate.exception.ConstraintViolationException`.
Continuing the previous example, when adding another `PhoneDetails`, Hibernate validates the uniqueness constraint when reloading the `Phone` object.

[[associations-one-to-one-bidirectional-lazy]]
====== Bidirectional `@OneToOne` lazy association

Although you might annotate the parent-side association to be fetched lazily,
Hibernate cannot honor this request since it cannot know whether the association is `null` or not.

The only way to figure out whether there is an associated record on the child side is to fetch the child association using a secondary query.
Because this can lead to N+1 query issues, it's much more efficient to use unidirectional `@OneToOne` associations with the `@MapsId` annotation in place.

However, if you really need to use a bidirectional association and want to make sure that this is always going to be fetched lazily,
then you need to enable lazy state initialization bytecode enhancement and use the
https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/{majorMinorVersion}/javadocs/org/hibernate/annotations/LazyToOne.html[`@LazyToOne`] annotation as well.

[[associations-many-to-many]]
==== `@ManyToMany`

The `@ManyToMany` association requires a link table that joins two entities.
Like the `@OneToMany` association, `@ManyToMany` can be either unidirectional or bidirectional.

[[associations-many-to-many-unidirectional]]
===== Unidirectional `@ManyToMany`

[[associations-many-to-many-unidirectional-example]]

include::{extrasdir}/associations-many-to-many-unidirectional-example.sql[]
----
====

Just like with unidirectional `@OneToMany` associations, the link table is controlled by the owning side.

When an entity is removed from the `@ManyToMany` collection, Hibernate simply deletes the joining record in the link table.
Unfortunately, this operation requires removing all entries associated with a given parent and recreating the ones that are listed in the current running persistent context.

----
====

[NOTE]
====
For `@ManyToMany` associations, the `REMOVE` entity state transition doesn't make sense to be cascaded because it will propagate beyond the link table.
Since the other side might be referenced by other entities on the parent-side, the automatic removal might end up in a `ConstraintViolationException`.

For example, if `@ManyToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)` was defined and the first person would be deleted,
Hibernate would throw an exception because another person is still associated with the address that's being deleted.

[source,java]
----
Person person1 = entityManager.find(Person.class, personId);
entityManager.remove(person1);

Caused by: javax.persistence.PersistenceException: org.hibernate.exception.ConstraintViolationException: could not execute statement

Caused by: java.sql.SQLIntegrityConstraintViolationException: integrity constraint violation: foreign key no action; FKM7J0BNABH2YR0PE99IL1D066U table: PERSON_ADDRESS
----
====

By simply removing the parent-side, Hibernate can safely remove the associated link records as you can see in the following example:

[[associations-many-to-many-bidirectional]]
===== Bidirectional `@ManyToMany`

A bidirectional `@ManyToMany` association has an owning and a `mappedBy` side.
To preserve synchronicity between both sides, it's good practice to provide helper methods for adding or removing child entities.

[[associations-many-to-many-bidirectional-example]]
.Bidirectional `@ManyToMany`

----

[source,sql]
----
include::{extrasdir}/associations-many-to-many-bidirectional-example.sql[]
----
====

With the helper methods in place, the synchronicity management can be simplified, as you can see in the following example:

[[associations-many-to-many-bidirectional-lifecycle-example]]
.Bidirectional `@ManyToMany` lifecycle

include::{extrasdir}/associations-many-to-many-bidirectional-lifecycle-example.sql[]
----
====

If a bidirectional `@OneToMany` association performs better when removing or changing the order of child elements,
the `@ManyToMany` relationship cannot benefit from such an optimization because the foreign key side is not in control.
To overcome this limitation, the link table must be directly exposed and the `@ManyToMany` association split into two bidirectional `@OneToMany` relationships.

[[associations-many-to-many-bidirectional-with-link-entity]]
===== Bidirectional many-to-many with a link entity

To most natural `@ManyToMany` association follows the same logic employed by the database schema,
and the link table has an associated entity which controls the relationship for both sides that need to be joined.

[[associations-many-to-many-bidirectional-with-link-entity-example]]
.Bidirectional many-to-many with link entity
====
[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/ManyToManyBidirectionalWithLinkEntityTest.java[tags=associations-many-to-many-bidirectional-with-link-entity-example,indent=0]
----

[source,sql]
----
include::{extrasdir}/associations-many-to-many-bidirectional-with-link-entity-example.sql[]
----
====

Both the `Person` and the `Address` have a `mappedBy` `@OneToMany` side, while the `PersonAddress` owns the `person` and the `address` `@ManyToOne` associations.
Because this mapping is formed out of two bidirectional associations, the helper methods are even more relevant.

[NOTE]
====
The aforementioned example uses a Hibernate specific mapping for the link entity since JPA doesn't allow building a composite identifier out of multiple `@ManyToOne` associations.
For more details, see the <<chapters/domain/identifiers.adoc#identifiers-composite-associations,Composite identifiers - associations>> section.
====

The entity state transitions are better managed than in the previous bidirectional `@ManyToMany` case.

----

----
include::{extrasdir}/associations-many-to-many-bidirectional-with-link-entity-lifecycle-example.sql[]
----
====

There is only one delete statement executed because, this time, the association is controlled by the `@ManyToOne` side which only has to monitor the state of the underlying foreign key relationship to trigger the right DML statement.

[[associations-not-found]]
==== `@NotFound` association mapping

When dealing with associations which are not enforced by a Foreign Key,
it's possible to bump into inconsistencies if the child record cannot reference a parent entity.

By default, Hibernate will complain whenever a child association references a non-existing parent record.
However, you can configure this behavior so that Hibernate can ignore such an Exception and simply assign `null` as a parent object referenced.

To ignore non-existing parent entity references, even though not really recommended, it's possible to use the annotation `org.hibernate.annotation.NotFound` annotation with a value of `org.hibernate.annotations.NotFoundAction.IGNORE`.

Considering the following `City` and `Person` entity mappings:
