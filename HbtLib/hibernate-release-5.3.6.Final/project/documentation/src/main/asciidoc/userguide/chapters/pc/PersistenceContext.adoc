Both the `org.hibernate.Session` API and `javax.persistence.EntityManager` API represent a context for dealing with persistent data.
This concept is called a `persistence context`.
Persistent data has a state in relation to both a persistence context and the underlying database.

`transient`:: the entity has just been instantiated and is not associated with a persistence context.
It has no persistent representation in the database and typically no identifier value has been assigned (unless the _assigned_ generator was used).
`managed`, or `persistent`:: the entity has an associated identifier and is associated with a persistence context.
It may or may not physically exist in the database yet.
`detached`:: the entity has an associated identifier but is no longer associated with a persistence context (usually because the persistence context was closed or the instance was evicted from the context)
`removed`:: the entity has an associated identifier and is associated with a persistence context, however, it is scheduled for removal from the database.

Much of the `org.hibernate.Session` and `javax.persistence.EntityManager` methods deal with moving entities between these states.

[[pc-unwrap]]
=== Accessing Hibernate APIs from JPA

JPA defines an incredibly useful method to allow applications access to the APIs of the underlying provider.

[[pc-persist]]
=== Making entities persistent

Once you've created a new entity instance (using the standard `new` operator) it is in `new` state.
You can make it persistent by associating it to either a `org.hibernate.Session` or `javax.persistence.EntityManager`.

====

`org.hibernate.Session` also has a method named persist which follows the exact semantic defined in the JPA specification for the persist method.
It is this `org.hibernate.Session` method to which the Hibernate `javax.persistence.EntityManager` implementation delegates.

If the `DomesticCat` entity type has a generated identifier, the value is associated with the instance when the save or persist is called.
If the identifier is not automatically generated, the manually assigned (usually natural) key value has to be set on the instance before the save or persist methods are called.

[[pc-remove]]
=== Deleting (removing) entities

Entities can also be deleted.

[NOTE]
====
Hibernate itself can handle deleting detached state.
JPA, however, disallows it.
The implication here is that the entity instance passed to the `org.hibernate.Session` delete method can be either in managed or detached state,
while the entity instance passed to remove on `javax.persistence.EntityManager` must be in the managed state.
====

[[pc-get-reference]]
=== Obtain an entity reference without initializing its data

Sometimes referred to as lazy loading, the ability to obtain a reference to an entity without having to load its data is hugely important.
The most common case being the need to create an association between an entity and another existing entity.

----
include::{sourcedir}/PersistenceContextTest.java[tags=pc-get-reference-native-example]
----
====

The above works on the assumption that the entity is defined to allow lazy loading, generally through use of runtime proxies.
In both cases an exception will be thrown later if the given entity does not refer to actual database state when the application attempts to use the returned proxy in any way that requires access to its data.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Unless the entity class is declared `final`, the proxy extends the entity class. If the entity class is `final`, the proxy will implement an interface instead. See the <<chapters/domain/entity.adoc#entity-proxy, `@Proxy` mapping>> section for more info.
====

[[pc-find]]
=== Obtain an entity with its data initialized

It is also quite common to want to obtain an entity along with its data (e.g. like when we need to display it in the UI).

[[pc-find-natural-id]]
=== Obtain an entity by natural-id

In addition to allowing to load the entity by its identifier, Hibernate allows applications to load entities by the declared natural identifier.

include::{sourcedir}/PersistenceContextTest.java[tags=pc-find-optional-by-simple-natural-id-example]
----
====

Hibernate offers a consistent API for accessing persistent data by identifier or by the natural-id. Each of these defines the same two data access methods:

getReference::
	Should be used in cases where the identifier is assumed to exist, where non-existence would be an actual error.
	Should never be used to test existence.
	That is because this method will prefer to create and return a proxy if the data is not already associated with the Session rather than hit the database.
	The quintessential use-case for using this method is to create foreign key based associations.
load::
	Will return the persistent data associated with the given identifier value or null if that identifier does not exist.

Each of these two methods defines an overloading variant accepting a `org.hibernate.LockOptions` argument.
Locking is discussed in a separate <<chapters/locking/Locking.adoc#locking,chapter>>.

[[pc-managed-state]]
=== Modifying managed/persistent state

Entities in managed/persistent state may be manipulated by the application, and any changes will be automatically detected and persisted when the persistence context is flushed.
There is no need to call a particular method to make your modifications persistent.

By default, when you modify an entity, all columns but the identifier are being set during update.

Therefore, considering you have the following `Product` entity mapping:

When you modify the `Product` entity, Hibernate generates the following SQL UPDATE statement:

====

The default UPDATE statement containing all columns has two advantages:

- it allows you to better benefit from JDBC Statement caching.
- it allows you to enable batch updates even if multiple entities modify different properties.

However, there is also one downside to including all columns in the SQL UPDATE statement.
If you have multiple indexes, the database might update those redundantly even if you don't actually modify all column values.

To fix this issue, you can use dynamic updates.

[[pc-managed-state-dynamic-update]]
==== Dynamic updates

To enable dynamic updates, you need to annotate the entity with the `@DynamicUpdate` annotation:

The dynamic update allows you to set just the columns that were modified in the associated entity.

[[pc-refresh]]
=== Refresh entity state

You can reload an entity instance and its collections at any time.

----
include::{sourcedir}/PersistenceContextTest.java[tags=pc-refresh-native-example]
----
====

One case where this is useful is when it is known that the database state has changed since the data was read.
Refreshing allows the current database state to be pulled into the entity instance and the persistence context.

Another case where this might be useful is when database triggers are used to initialize some of the properties of the entity.

[NOTE]
====
Only the entity instance and its value type collections are refreshed unless you specify `REFRESH` as a cascade style of any associations.
However, please note that Hibernate has the capability to handle this automatically through its notion of generated properties.
See the discussion of non-identifier <<chapters/domain/basic_types.adoc#mapping-generated,generated attributes>>.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Traditionally, Hibernate has been allowing detached entities to be refreshed.
Unfortunately, JPA prohibits this practice and specifies that an `IllegalArgumentException` should be thrown instead.

For this reason, when bootstrapping the Hibernate `SessionFactory` using the native API, the legacy detached entity refresh behavior is going to be preserved.
On the other hand, when bootstrapping Hibernate through JPA `EntityManagerFactory` building process, detached entities are not allowed to be refreshed by default.

However, this default behavior can be overwritten through the `hibernate.allow_refresh_detached_entity` configuration property.
If this property is explicitly set to `true`, then you can refresh detached entities even when using the JPA bootstraps mechanism, therefore bypassing the JPA specification restriction.

For more about the `hibernate.allow_refresh_detached_entity` configuration property,
check out the <<appendices/Configurations.adoc#misc,Configurations>> section as well.
====

[[pc-refresh-gotchas]]
==== Refresh gotchas

The `refresh` entity state transition is meant to overwrite the entity attributes according to the info currently contained in the associated database record.

However, you have to be very careful when cascading the refresh action to any transient entity.

For instance, consider the following example:

[[pc-refresh-child-entity-jpa-example]]
.Refreshing entity state gotcha
====
[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/PersistenceContextTest.java[tags=pc-refresh-child-entity-jpa-example]
----
====

In the aforementioned example, an `EntityNotFoundException` is thrown because the `Book` entity is still in a transient state.
When the refresh action is cascaded from the `Person` entity, Hibernate will not be able to locate the `Book` entity in the database.

For this reason, you should be very careful when mixing the refresh action with transient child entity objects.

[[pc-detach]]
=== Working with detached data

Detachment is the process of working with data outside the scope of any persistence context.
Data becomes detached in a number of ways.
Once the persistence context is closed, all data that was associated with it becomes detached.
Clearing the persistence context has the same effect.
Evicting a particular entity from the persistence context makes it detached.
And finally, serialization will make the deserialized form be detached (the original instance is still managed).

Detached data can still be manipulated, however, the persistence context will no longer automatically know about these modifications, and the application will need to intervene to make the changes persistent again.

[[pc-detach-reattach]]
==== Reattaching detached data

Reattachment is the process of taking an incoming entity instance that is in the detached state and re-associating it with the current persistence context.

[IMPORTANT]
====
JPA does not provide for this model. This is only available through Hibernate `org.hibernate.Session`.
====

====
[source, JAVA, indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/PersistenceContextTest.java[tags=pc-detach-reattach-saveOrUpdate-example]
----
====

[NOTE]
====
The method name `update` is a bit misleading here.
It does not mean that an `SQL` `UPDATE` is immediately performed.
It does, however, mean that an `SQL` `UPDATE` will be performed when the persistence context is flushed since Hibernate does not know its previous state against which to compare for changes.
If the entity is mapped with `select-before-update`, Hibernate will pull the current state from the database and see if an update is needed.
====

Provided the entity is detached, `update` and `saveOrUpdate` operate exactly the same.

[[pc-merge]]
==== Merging detached data

Merging is the process of taking an incoming entity instance that is in the detached state and copying its data over onto a new managed instance.

Although not exactly per se, the following example is a good visualization of the `merge` operation internals.

[[pc-merge-gotchas]]
===== Merging gotchas

For example, Hibernate throws `IllegalStateException` when merging a parent entity which has references to 2 detached child entities `child1` and `child2` (obtained from different sessions), and `child1` and `child2` represent the same persistent entity, `Child`.

A new configuration property, `hibernate.event.merge.entity_copy_observer`, controls how Hibernate will respond when multiple representations of the same persistent entity ("entity copy") is detected while merging.

The possible values are:

disallow (the default):: throws `IllegalStateException` if an entity copy is detected
allow:: performs the merge operation on each entity copy that is detected
log:: (provided for testing only) performs the merge operation on each entity copy that is detected and logs information about the entity copies.
This setting requires DEBUG logging be enabled for `org.hibernate.event.internal.EntityCopyAllowedLoggedObserver`.

In addition, the application may customize the behavior by providing an implementation of `org.hibernate.event.spi.EntityCopyObserver` and setting `hibernate.event.merge.entity_copy_observer` to the class name.
When this property is set to `allow` or `log`, Hibernate will merge each entity copy detected while cascading the merge operation.
In the process of merging each entity copy, Hibernate will cascade the merge operation from each entity copy to its associations with `cascade=CascadeType.MERGE` or `CascadeType.ALL`.
The entity state resulting from merging an entity copy will be overwritten when another entity copy is merged.

[WARNING]
====
Because cascade order is undefined, the order in which the entity copies are merged is undefined.
As a result, if property values in the entity copies are not consistent, the resulting entity state will be indeterminate, and data will be lost from all entity copies except for the last one merged.
Therefore, the *last writer wins*.


If an entity copy cascades the merge operation to an association that is (or contains) a new entity, that new entity will be merged (i.e., persisted and the merge operation will be cascaded to its associations according to its mapping),
even if that same association is ultimately overwritten when Hibernate merges a different representation having a different value for its association.

If the association is mapped with `orphanRemoval = true`, the new entity will not be deleted because the semantics of orphanRemoval do not apply if the entity being orphaned is a new entity.

There are known issues when representations of the same persistent entity have different values for a collection.
See https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-9239[HHH-9239] and https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-9240[HHH-9240] for more details.
These issues can cause data loss or corruption.

By setting `hibernate.event.merge.entity_copy_observer` configuration property to `allow` or `log`,
Hibernate will allow entity copies of any type of entity to be merged.

The only way to exclude particular entity classes or associations that contain critical data is to provide a custom implementation of `org.hibernate.event.spi.EntityCopyObserver` with the desired behavior,
and setting `hibernate.event.merge.entity_copy_observer` to the class name.
====

[TIP]
====
Hibernate provides limited DEBUG logging capabilities that can help determine the entity classes for which entity copies were found.
By setting `hibernate.event.merge.entity_copy_observer` to `log` and enabling DEBUG logging for `org.hibernate.event.internal.EntityCopyAllowedLoggedObserver`,
the following will be logged each time an application calls `EntityManager.merge( entity )` or +
`Session.merge( entity )`:

- number of times multiple representations of the same persistent entity was detected summarized by entity name;
- details by entity name and ID, including output from calling toString() on each representation being merged as well as the merge result.

The log should be reviewed to determine if multiple representations of entities containing critical data are detected.
If so, the application should be modified so there is only one representation, and a custom implementation of `org.hibernate.event.spi.EntityCopyObserver` should be provided to disallow entity copies for entities with critical data.

Using optimistic locking is recommended to detect if different representations are from different versions of the same persistent entity.
If they are not from the same version, Hibernate will throw either the JPA `OptimisticLockException` or the native `StaleObjectStateException` depending on your bootstrapping strategy.

=== Evicting entities

When the `flush()` method is called, the state of the entity is synchronized with the database.
If you do not want this synchronization to occur, or if you are processing a huge number of objects and need to manage memory efficiently,
the `evict()` method can be used to remove the object and its collections from the first-level cache.

[[pc-cascade]]
=== Cascading entity state transitions

JPA allows you to propagate the state transition from a parent entity to a child.
For this purpose, the JPA `javax.persistence.CascadeType` defines various cascade types:

`ALL`:: cascades all entity state transitions
`PERSIST`:: cascades the entity persist operation.
`MERGE`:: cascades the entity merge operation.
`REMOVE`:: cascades the entity remove operation.
`REFRESH`:: cascades the entity refresh operation.
`DETACH`:: cascades the entity detach operation.

Additionally, the `CascadeType.ALL` will propagate any Hibernate-specific operation, which is defined by the `org.hibernate.annotations.CascadeType` enum:

`SAVE_UPDATE`:: cascades the entity saveOrUpdate operation.
`REPLICATE`:: cascades the entity replicate operation.
`LOCK`:: cascades the entity lock operation.

The following examples will explain some of the aforementioned cascade operations using the following entities:

Even if just the `Person` parent entity was persisted, Hibernate has managed to cascade the persist operation to the associated `Phone` child entity as well.

During merge, the current state of the entity is copied onto the entity version that was just fetched from the database.
That's the reason why Hibernate executed the SELECT statement which fetched both the `Person` entity along with its children.

[[pc-cascade-remove]]
==== `CascadeType.REMOVE`

The `CascadeType.REMOVE` allows us to remove a child entity along with the parent one.
Traditionally, Hibernate called this operation delete, that's why the `org.hibernate.annotations.CascadeType` provides a `DELETE` cascade option.

However, `CascadeType.LOCK` allows us to reattach a parent entity along with its children to the currently running Persistence Context.

While the previous cascade types propagate entity state transitions, the `@OnDelete` cascade is a DDL-level FK feature which allows you
to remove a child record whenever the parent row is deleted.

So, when annotating the `@ManyToOne` association with `@OnDelete( action = OnDeleteAction.CASCADE )`,
the automatic schema generator will apply the ON DELETE CASCADE SQL directive to the Foreign Key declaration,
as illustrated by the following example.

Now, you can just remove the `Person` entity, and the associated `Phone` is going to be removed automatically.
